//
//  Write a program that calculates the occupancy rate for a hotel. The program should
//  start by asking the user how many floors the hotel has. A loop should then iterate once
//  for each floor. In each iteration, the loop should ask the user for the number of rooms
//  on the floor and how many of them are occupied. After all the iterations, the program
//  should display how many rooms the hotel has, how many of them are occupied, how
//  many are unoccupied, and the percentage of rooms that are occupied. The percentage
//  may be calculated by dividing the number of rooms occupied by the number of rooms.
//
//  NOTE: It is traditional that most hotels do not have a thirteenth floor. The loop in
//  this program should skip the entire thirteenth iteration.
//
//  Input Validation: Do not accept a value of less than 1 for the number of floors. Do not
//  accept a number less than 10 for the number of rooms on a floor.
